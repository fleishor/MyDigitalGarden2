## Github GraphQL explorer

Github offers a very good GraphQL api including an explorer: <https://docs.github.com/de/graphql/overview/explorer> based on GraphiQL <https://github.com/graphql/graphiql>

At first we must SignIn to Github and give the explorer access to Github

After SignIn we can run our first query

Important keyboard short cuts:

- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>Enter</kbd>: Run the query
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>Space</kbd>: Open IntelliSense

GraphQL explorer has also a kind of IntelliSense which shows all possible attributes
